# ST10488186-PROG121-POE

This project is part of my PROG121 Practical. 
It is a Java program that allows users to register, log in, and send messages.

Part 1: User Registration
- Users can create an account by entering a username, password, and phone number.
- The program checks if the details are valid before saving.
- After registration, users can log in using their details.

Part 2: Messaging
- After logging in, users can send messages.
- Each message has:
  - Message ID (max 10 characters)
  - Recipient number (starts with 0 and max 10 digits)
  - Message text (max 250 characters)
- Valid messages are stored in a JSON file called messages.json.

Testing
- JUnit tests were created to check user registration, login, and message validation.
- Test files: UserRegistrationTest.java and MessageTest.java

Continuous Integration (CI)
- GitHub Actions was used to automate testing with Maven.
- The workflow file is in: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Tests run automatically whenever code is pushed to GitHub.

Tools and Libraries Used
- Java
- Maven
- JUnit
- org.json
- GitHub Actions

ChatGPT helped with the JSON message storing method.
